## I. Project Overview

Our database project is an iOS app for the **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)** assessment.  The app allows users to take multiple assessments and read about differing personality types.

Each assessment presents a series of statements, and asks users to respond with how strongly they agree or disagree with them. Each statement is designed to indicate a preference in one of the following categories:

* **I**ntroversion vs **E**xtraversion
* **S**ensing vs I**N**tuition
* **T**hinking vs **F**eeling
* **J**udging vs **P**erceiving

Once a user has finished taking the assessment, their responses are weighed to produce a four-letter Personality Type such as "INTJ" or "ESFP" and the user is then presented with relevant information about their Personality Type as well as links to any of the other types if they wish to learn more.

Each assessment is stored and multiple assessments can be taken and saved under different names.
