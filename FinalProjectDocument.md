# CSC 455 Group Project Information

## I. Written overview or summary of the project

For our CSC 455 final project, we decided to create an iOS app for the Myers Briggs Personality Type assessment.  The purpose of our app was to allow users to learn more about themselves and others through taking the assessment and reading information about the different types.

Functionally, our app was written using SwiftUI and a package called SQLite for writing our SQLite queries directly.  We used sql for loading, storing, and comparing information about different personality types and groups.

During development we encountered issues with converting the sql queries into direct Swift code and implementing that into the app.  However, we were able to get the queries and the UI working independently of one another.
