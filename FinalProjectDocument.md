The project will be scored as follows:

1. Project Summary 10%
2. Final, Logical E-R diagram 10%
3. Schema, Table design, Relationships, & Data 35%
4. Supporting Queries and Functionality (including front-end) 35%
5. Group evaluation 10%

_To submit, please zip and upload your project summary and ER diagram. Also provide a URL and/or instructions about using the front-end. Include any other information I may need for grading. One member of the group can submit this part. Please also complete the confidential group evaluation form in the separate Canvas assignment. Everyone should do this individually._
